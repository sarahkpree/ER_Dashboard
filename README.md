### Project Overview
This project involved creating an ER dashboard using simulated patient census data spanning 18 months, with nine visualizations including total patient encounters, gender breakdown, admission rates, average wait time and satisfaction scores over time, age group distribution, patient race breakdown, department referral distribution, and a heatmap of average wait time by day and time. This dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of ER operations, enabling professionals to monitor patient flow, demographic trends, and service efficiency. Such insights are important for optimizing resource allocation, improving patient satisfaction, and improving quality of care.

### Data Sources
The primary dataset used for this analysis is the "EmergencyRoom_Dashboard.csv" file, containing patient census data, satisfaction score, wait time, and admission pinformation. 

### Tools

- Excel - Data Inspection
- Tableau - Data Visualization

### Limitations
-  The dashboard only provides a snapshot of certain aspects of ER operations and patient demographics. It does not capture all relevant factors such as staffing levels, resource availability, or severity of patient conditions.
-  The dashboard remains static, lacking the ability to update with evolving data as of now.
